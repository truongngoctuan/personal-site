            "synopsis": "<p>A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen&#39;s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially <a href=\"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens\">I Shall Seal the Heavens</a>. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen&#39;s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.&nbsp;</p><p>For a more detailed introduction, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ehD2eGR5sTA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out this video by the translator himself</a>!</p>",

They pledge themselves to their dreams yet often compromise, are angels that are also devils&hellip; It&rsquo;s why I hate them.</em></p><p><em>And also love them.</em></p><p>The only hope of his family, a youth with the blood of elves and demons walks on a battleground of annihilation and rebirth. He wills his way through boiling lava and icy depths, making a killing on this field of despair to strike down the lofty figure in his sight. One day he&rsquo;ll grasp his blade tightly and survey his surroundings, only to find no more enemies to kill.</p>",

Humanity, standing on the shoulders of legends from its history, advanced soul technology to inconceivable heights. The humans of Douluo invented weapons of mass destruction, mechanized armor, and living metals. With these advancements, they went on to conquer the oceans and discovered two new continents. To fuel these new technologies, humanity hunted the soul beasts to the very brink of extinction.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Once the dominant force of Douluo, the few surviving soul beasts now hide in the darkest recesses of their last sanctuary. The weakest have all been hunted, leaving only the strongest to scheme in the heart of the forest. The soul beasts, not willing to fade away, plot an uprising for their survival. In the midst of this, a god from a long forgotten era awakens in the depths of the Great Star Dou Forest to seek vengeance for the soul beasts.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As darkness encroaches from the abyss, hope is found in a young boy who holds a power beyond divinity within himself&mdash;Tang Wulin! Hope for both humanity and the soul beasts, as the bridge between the two. He finds his way into the fabled halls of Shrek Academy, where he learns to wield his prodigious powers, makes friends and finds allies, eventually rising to become a towering leader.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As he learns to harness his strength, danger lurks within the shadows as the various factions of humanity maneuver and plot to usurp Shrek Academy.

It had integrated itself into the real world&rsquo;s economy, with both corporations and individuals seeking their fortunes through the game. In this game,&nbsp;Nie Yan prided himself in his Level 180 Thief. He could barely be considered among the top experts in the game. Though, that was the only thing he could take pride in. He was penniless and unable to advance in life; a situation he was forced into by the enemy of his father. If it weren&rsquo;t for the little money he made by selling off items in Conviction, he would&rsquo;ve barely been able to eat.&nbsp;In the end, he&nbsp;chose to settle his matters once and for all. He assassinated his father&rsquo;s enemy. He lay dying shortly after being shot in the pursuit. However, that wasn&rsquo;t the end of his story. Instead, he awoke moments later to find that he had reincarnated into his past-self. Armed with his experience&nbsp;and knowledge of future events, he sets out to live his life anew.</p>",

Because the author set up the character in this way, the story was difficult for the readers to read.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">But as the main character encounters various people and geniuses, he internally matures and his personality changes. If the main character is described as cancerous early on, at present he can be called a mature adult. However, those who don&rsquo;t read beyond the early parts of the 5<sup style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;\">th</sup> volume (~ chapter 90) find it hard to believe.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">The basic settings and story line are similar to other VR novels, but the praiseworthy thing is the content development. The early parts aren&rsquo;t much different from rival novels, but the novel rating has exceeded the market average in recent years due to the writer&rsquo;s growth.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">Like other novels, it contains a munchkin element, but it is different from typical munchkins. In the early stages, the game progresses with the main character using his class of a legendary blacksmith. The main character expands the game content and the level of the existing users dramatically increase. Hidden talents, new players in the official rankings, classes that could break the balance, all of this makes the main character&rsquo;s one-man show impossible. The main character grows internally and externally while competing with others.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">In fact, if you compare the simple and ignorant battle method in the beginning to his abilities in the present time, it is possible to feel such a sense of distance that he doesn&rsquo;t seem like the same character.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">As for the evaluation of the work, the criticism was severe in the beginning, but the popularity increased rapidly after that. As described above, the improvement in the author&rsquo;s writing and the growth of the main character led to rapid changes in the comments. However, the main character&rsquo;s selfish and frustrating behaviour caused many readers to stop reading in the beginning. For the readers who have gone beyond the beginning, it is a tragedy that seems really pitiful.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">Currently, its popularity is increasing and a webtoon was recently released.

Foundation Establishment. Core Formation. On modern 21st century Earth, only these three realms are known to be achievable. Nascent Soul is but a legend and the realms above it lost to the long river of time. The current era is known as Cultivation Civilization, a balance of power and civility, excess and moderation. While cultivation remains a secret practice, it has long since exposed itself to the mundane world, quietly intertwined with each facet of society. While the world appears to be at peace, what lies underneath is a conflict between human, cultivator, and demon, brewing for ages and waiting to implode. Yet in the wake of humanity&rsquo;s rapid industrialization, qi&mdash;and consequently cultivation&mdash;is dying.&nbsp;</p><p>Besieged on all sides by forces both human and demon, Xu Yangyi, our protagonist, strives to reach the apex, armed only with esoteric knowledge and his cool pragmatism, and to avenge the unjust deaths of both his parents. Embroiled in conspiracy and with adversity waiting at each turn, he is undeterred in his conquest to seek the Grand Dao and break free of this world&rsquo;s shackles, claiming his title as the pioneer of an era!</p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><strong>Translator&rsquo;s Technical Synopsis:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Archfiend</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;is a novel on Zongheng categorized as a &ldquo;different city&rdquo; novel. It starts in the year 2016 and is supposed to exist in our world. The novel combines elements from the modern city genre and the classic xianxia genre to create a story that I feel is very different from what most readers are used to.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Archfiend</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;draws heavily on Chinese myth, history, and culture to form an engrossing, but slow, plotline.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The author&rsquo;s past works include&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Super Entertainment Dynasty&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Emperor&rsquo;s Super Star Cultivation System</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">.
