Health is promoted through wide public interest in these events, in which new world records may be set, and a fierce competitive spirit is fostered.  Extensive sports coverage on TV fires the imagination of the youth of the host country, all keen to take up sport and emulate their national heroes. <b class=\"calibre2\">In terms of </b>the economy<b class=\"calibre2\">, </b>hospitality and tourism benefit from the influx of sports fans from all over the world.  An event such as the Olympic Games, <b class=\"calibre2\">for</b> <b class=\"calibre2\">example</b>, provides a kind of shop window for the host nation to advertise its attractions for tourists. <b class=\"calibre2\"> </b></p>"
